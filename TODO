Mid-term
========

- types/*.xml: convert to typemaker2 (partially done)


Long-term
=========

- very much simplify API (just jobs, accounts and probably bank info)
- probably remove country info stuff
- remove data storage stuff (APPS should store their info themselves)
- remove message engine stuff, use gparser instead
