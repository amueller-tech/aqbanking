Next:
=====
- AH_JOB:
  - add virtual function AH_Job_HandleResult and implement it
  - remove exchange functions
  - process(): add code from exchange(results)
- AH_PROVIDER:
  - remove functions of old API
  - start adapting the account/user setup dialogs
- AB_BANKING: remove old exec code


- split AqBanking into two libraries: One for direct use by applications, the other shall contain
  functions needed by backends and plugins. This should reduce the number symbols exported to applications



Mid-term
========

- types/*.xml: convert to typemaker2 (partially done)

- internal:
  - AB_ACCOUNT and AB_USER should be handled by the backends only
      - these structures are currently way to fat for applications because
        they also contain internal info for the backends which are absolutely
        not needed by applications. They also make it very conplicated to manage
        users and accounts.
  - backend functions to be used by setup apps:
    - getAccounts()
    - getUsers()
  - simplify backend-api:
    - updateAccountSpecs(): called upon AB_Banking_Init(), if there are no account specs
    - executeJobs():
        - Temporary loads necessary accounts and user
        - executes the jobs
        - updates account specs
        - unloads accounts and users



Long-term
=========

- very much simplify API (just jobs, accounts and probably bank info)
- probably remove country info stuff
- remove data storage stuff (APPS should store their info themselves)
- remove message engine stuff, use gparser instead




Old
===

- loganalyzer: read messages from FASTBUFFER instead from IO

CAVEATS:
- you need to call AB_Job_CheckAvailability() after creating a job


- generic settings
  - bank code
  - bank name
  - hbci version
  - bank url
  - flags:
    - userId == customerId

- settings in DDV mode:
  - flags:

    - bankUsesSignSeq

- settings in RDH mode

    - bankUsesSignSeq
  

- settings in pin/tan mode
  - http version
  - flags
    - forceSslv3
    - noBase64
    - omitSmsAccount


- send a local branch under the same name to server:
  "git push -u origin HEAD"
