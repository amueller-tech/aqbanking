- job list for user:
   - contains jobs to be sent for a given user, from those the job queue will be filled
- job queue:
   - contains jobs to be sent now to the bank
   - there is only one job queue


- sending jobs in HBCI mode:
  - create message 1
  - for every job from the queue:
    - get segment and DB from job
    - set segment number accordingly
    - encode and add segment to commandBuffer
  - if message needs signing:
    - for every signer:
      - create signature head
      - encode signature head
      - hash data from signature head
      - hash data from commandBuffer (jobs to sign)
      - add signature head to fullMessageBuffer
      - create signature tail, set hash
      - add signature tail to tailBuffer
    - add commandBuffer to fullMessageBuffer
    - add signatureTails to fullMessageBuffer
  - if message needs crypting:
    - generate crypt head
    - add crypt head to encryptedMessageBuffer
    - generate and encode crypt data segment
    - add crypt data segment to encryptedMessageBuffer
    - exchange encryptedMessageBuffer and fullMessageBuffer
  - determine full size of HBCI message
  - generate message head
  - insert message head into fullMessageBuffer
