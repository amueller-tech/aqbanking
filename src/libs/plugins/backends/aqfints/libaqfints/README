AqFinTS Backend

This module was created in an attempt to create a test HBCI server, because it is
not easy to get supported access to HBCI test servers at banks.

This module is generic regarding its usability for client and server libraries/apps.
The idea is to reuse the code for client and server code which may lead to a new FINTS module
in the process.

This module is shared across AqBanking and AqBankServers.


parser
------
This folder contains the HBCI encoder/decoder.


msglayer
--------
Code to organize segments into messages.


servicelayer
------------
The module in this folder makes use of the HBCI codec and defines segments and
jobs pertaining to the HBCI/FinTS protocol.


sessionlayer
------------
Code in this folder handles encoding and decoding messages of the HBCI protocol including
handling of the cryptographic mechanisms defined by that protocol (e.g. signing and encryption).


transportlayer
--------------
This layer contains code for exchanging messages between clients and servers.
