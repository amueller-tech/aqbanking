AqFinTS Backend

This module was created in an attempt to create a test HBCI server, because it is
not easy to get supported access to HBCI test servers at banks.

This module is generic regarding its usability for client and server libraries/apps.
The idea is to reuse the code for client and server code which may lead to a new FINTS module
in the process.
